"""Worktree and port management operations for isolated ADW workflows.

Provides utilities for creating and managing git worktrees under trees/<adw_id>/
and allocating unique ports for each isolated instance.

NOTE: the *worktree* helpers below (create_worktree, remove_worktree,
get_worktree_path, validate_worktree) are legacy and dormant — they hardcode the
harness repo root + `origin/main` and have no callers. For creating a worktree of
an arbitrary target repo, use adw_modules/feature_worktree.create_feature_worktree
instead. The *port* helpers (get_ports_for_adw, is_port_available,
find_next_available_ports) remain in active use and are imported by
feature_worktree.

Port allocations are pure harness runtime state and must NEVER be written into
the target worktree: a `.ports.env` there rode blanket `git add -A` phase
commits into target-repo PRs across 8+ runs against an early target repo.
Allocations live under the harness `agents/<adw_id>/ports.json`
(feature_worktree.save_port_allocation) and reach child processes as env vars.
